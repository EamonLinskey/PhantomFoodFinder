# Privacy Policy for Phantom Food Finder

At Phantom Food Finder, we take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide to us.

Collection and Use of Information

Phantom Food Finder is a Chrome extension that helps users identify legitimate restaurants when ordering food online. We collect the longitude and latitude location data of each restaurant on food service websites that users visit. This information is only used to make an API call to the Google Place API to determine whether the restaurant can be verified or if it is potentially a ghost kitchen. We do not store any user information or website information on our end. We do cache data locally on the user's machine to avoid making the same API call repeatedly. We only cache a mapping of the longitude latitude pair with the nearby business data from the Google Place API response data.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share any user information with third parties. The information we collect is solely used for the purpose of providing our service to our users. We do not store or share any information on our end.

Data Retention

We do not store any user information or website information on our end. We only cache the nearby business data from the Google Place API response locally on the users' machine to avoid duplicate API calls.


Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify our users of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here.
