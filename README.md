# Phantom Food Finder

Phantom Food Finder is a Google Chrome extension that helps users identify ghost kitchens on popular food delivery services. The extension uses the Google Places API to compare restaurant names and addresses, and provides users with a "Ghost-Free" badge for verified restaurants, a "Haunted" tooltip for potential ghost kitchens, and an "Unverified" badge for restaurants with incomplete data.

## Installation

Phantom Food Finder can be installed on Google Chrome from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phantom-food-finder/kpeejkehhanjpdbioghgmjdkijioncoo?fbclid=IwAR2fxNPzjbyF32FCtnDzEGuDHeHtitHQHCZ4IGJRGvwmnmIhRUWQrGIgk0k). 

## Usage

Once installed, Phantom Food Finder will automatically detect the food delivery service you're using and check the restaurant's legitimacy in real-time. If the restaurant is verified, a "Ghost-Free" badge will appear next to the name. If the restaurant is potentially a ghost kitchen, a "Haunted" badge will appear with a tooltip that lists nearby businesses that may be using the same name. If the restaurant is unverified, an "Unverified" badge will appear with a tooltip explaining the situation.

While Phantom Food Finder is designed to be as accurate as possible in, it's important to keep in mind that there may be cases where the app incorrectly identifies a restaurant. This could happen due to inconsistencies in business names or address conventions, or other factors beyond the app's control. Therefore, if you want to be 100% confident in our assessment, we recommend following the link provided in the tooltip to the google maps of the listed address and seeing if the restaurant exists at that location.
